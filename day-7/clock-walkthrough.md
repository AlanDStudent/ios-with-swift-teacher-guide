##Clock App

Completed project code [here]()

###Students Will Be Able To
- Strengthen their knowledge of:
  - building UIViews
  - adding constraints to a view
  - using IBOutlets to connect view elements to controller code
- Recognize controller lifecycle events and relate them to methods such as viewDidLoad.

###Why
Adding a timing element to an app can be very useful. Most games out there have some variation of a gameplay clock. Any social networking app displays a time and date for users comments, posted pictures, and or events. Banking apps often time out after a period of time to protect users' information.

###Walkthrough
