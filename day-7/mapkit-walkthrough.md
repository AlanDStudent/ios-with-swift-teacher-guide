##MapKit Walkthrough

###Students Will Be Able To
- Embed a map directly in their app with MapKit View
- Annotate their app's map with MKAnnotationView

###Why
Maps can be a very useful addition to your app. Also, more object-oriented programming! MapKit is a framework that uses the same patterns we've seen for UIKit; more importantly, it uses the same patterns as WebKit, SiriKit, and many more APIs you can use in your iOS apps.  

###Walkthrough
- Create a one-page application in Xcode called MyFirstMapApp.
- In the ViewController, add the line import MapKit to the top of the file.
