###Conclusion
- Classes and Structures allow us to create the building blocks of our code. They organize our programs and make it easier to increase in scale.
- Since structs are only used for very simple cases of data encapsulation, in practice most custom data constructs should be classes, not structures.
- The init method allows for custom initialization. Otherwise, the instance will be instantiated with the default values that you defined.
- A method is a function that belongs to an instance of a class.
- You can retrieve and set properties of an instance using dot syntax. In Swift, you do not need to write a method for these actions.
