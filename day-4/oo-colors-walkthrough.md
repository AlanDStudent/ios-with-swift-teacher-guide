###Students Will Be Able To
- Build a one-page application that changes its background color to a new, random RGB value with the press of a button.
- Apply object-oriented principles to a new kind of problem.

###Why
Changing the background color of our app can easily be accomplished without creating our own structures. However, this exercise is a good demonstration of how code can be organized in an object-oriented fashion.
