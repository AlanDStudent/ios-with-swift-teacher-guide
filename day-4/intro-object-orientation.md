##Object Orientation

###Students Will Be Able To
- Decide whether a structure or class would be appropriate in a given situation
- Define a class or a struct
- Create an instance of a class or a struct
- Access and set properties of a class or a struct
- Define instance methods for a class or a struct

###Why
Who knows how many people are on Facebook? Close to a quarter of the world is on Facebook (roughly 2 billion). What do you think the average number of friends a user has? What about the number of photos? How many likes happen in a day? We're talking about trillions of pieces of data that Facebook tracks and stores on huge tracts of land that they bought literally just to store all their data.

When you log in, how does Facebook know to your data? Your exact profile and data loaded for you and you alone, and not someone else's? How does that work? How in the world are they able to do that for 2 billion users?

Object Orientation is a way to organize, manipulate and store data. It's so powerful that it gives companies like Facebook the ability to do that - Have them name apps (Instagram, Snapchat, Square or Strip, Spotify). It's one of the most important and pervasive concepts in computer programming and supports all sorts of applications like Instagram and Facebook, to ESPN to payment apps like Amazon payment. In fact, you guys are going to build your own payment system tomorrow.

The answer is through a type of programming called object-oriented programming. It's a way a building new objects (alien enemies, Sim people, cars, etc.) by making "factories" that standardize how the objects are made. Programmers don't have to code every car in GTA individually, every Facebook account, or every Amazon payment. What they do is create a template for objects that can then be tailored without having to recreate all of the code for each new object. The same goes for applications like Facebook and Twitter.

###Anticipated Pain Points
- Understanding the differences between classes and structures will be hard to understand at first, and the students do not need an immediate grasp of this. In Swift, classes and structures are very similar and often either option will work very well. If they are confused reiterate that most custom data constructs will be classes, so a class is a good default choice.
