##Goals:
- Introduce dictionaries as another type of collection
- What is Object Orientation?
- Introduce classes and structures
- Introduce Constraints

##SWBATS:
- determine when a dictionary is more beneficial over an array
- create a new dictionary
- edit/add to existing dictionaries
- retrieve values from dictionaries
- use common instance properties and methods made for dictionaries
- determine when structs or classes should be used
- define class and struct
- create instances of classes and structs
- access set properties of a class/struct
- define instance methods for a class/struct
- utilize class/struct within an app
- build views using contraints and autolayout
