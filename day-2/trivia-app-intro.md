##Beginning an Xcode Project from Scratch
- Open Xcode and select "Create a new Xcode Project"
  - Xcode presents you with many types of boilerplate code (code that is written for us so that we start with a partially written app). Select "Single View Application" under "iOS application".
- Call your product "TriviaApps", the language should be Swift, and the Devices should be iPhone.
