##Functions
####Motivation
Think about all of the built-in methods we've used for Strings and Arrays: count(), insert(), removeAtIndex(), ect. They took common tasks and packaged up the code for everyone to use. We can create our own methods, or functions, to organize our code and prevent repetition.

- Imagine that we want to give somebody instructions. Let's say, to bake a cake.
```Swift
print("1. Take out a bowl and mixing spoon.")
print("2. Add 2 cups of sugar to the bowl.")
print("3. Mix in 1.5 cups of flour.")
print("4. Add 1 teaspoon of salt.")
print("5. Mix in 1 tablespoon of baking powder.")
print("6. Combine two eggs and two cups of milk in a bowl and stir.")
print("7. Add eggs and milk to dry ingredients.")
print("8. Bake for 45 minutes at 375 degrees.")
```
