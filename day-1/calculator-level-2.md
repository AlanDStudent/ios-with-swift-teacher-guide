##Calculator - Level Two

In this version of our calculator, our calculator is going to be able to differentiate between different types of operations and proceed appropriately.

The user will input information into several variables: num1 and num2 will hold whatever decimal values you want to enter, and mathOperator will hold a one-character string of the operation you want to execute. 

You will write a conditional statement that will calculate the answer with the correct operator.

######Bonus
Give your user the option for the answer to be automatically rounded to the nearest whole number.

######Double Bonus
Once you have the calculator working for simple math, add any additional functions that you think might be useful..
