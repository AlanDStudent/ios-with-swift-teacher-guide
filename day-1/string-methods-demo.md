Strings are a special data type that come with their own properties and methods. This just means that a string is able to tell us information about itself(instance properties), and it also has a set of actions that it can perform on itself(instance methods). 


Instance Properties |     Instance Methods
:----------------:  |    :------------------:
characters          |     append(_: Character)
endIndex            |     hasPrefix(_:)
lowercaseString     |     hasSuffix(_:)
startIndex          |     insert(_:atIndex:)
uppercaseString     |     removeAtIndex(_:)
