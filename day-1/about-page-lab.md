##About Page Lab
- So far we have done all of our coding in the Xcode playground, but that's not where iPhone or iPad apps actually get written. Let's take a look at [this folder](https://github.com/upperlinecode/intro-to-swift/tree/master/day-1/AboutPage) in Xcode.

####Xcode Project Layout
So far, we've only used the Xcode playground. When we create a new Xcode project, it creates a skeleton of an application for us, which consists of several different folders and files. Let's take a look at the new layout.
- Editor Area
  - Purpose: This is where the the core development tasks take place. When you open a file, it is displayed in the editor area. Right now, this should be where you see the layout of the beginning of an iphone app.
- Navigator
  - How to show: click the rectangular button in the upper right hand corner of Xcode (leftmost of three).
  - Purpose: Show your project's file structure.
  - There are three main folders in our project: AboutPage, AboutPageTests, and Products. Right now, we're only going to be looking at files in the AboutPage folder.
- Utilities
  - How to show: click the rectangular button in the upper right hand corner of Xcode (rightmost of three).
  - Purpose: Contains a variety of helpful tools. We will look at these as we begin developing our apps.
- Assistant Editor Area
  - How to show: click the button containing two overlapping circles in the upper right hand corner of Xcode.
  - Purpose: Allows you to view and edit multiple files at the same time.
- Debug Area
  - How to show: click the rectangular button in the upper right hand corner of Xcode (center of three).
  - Purpose: Shows output messages. These might include print messages you put in your code, or error messages generated by Swift.
