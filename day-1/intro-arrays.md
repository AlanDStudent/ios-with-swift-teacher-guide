- Motivation: prompt students to think of things that they would organize in a list. Have them discuss drawbacks to having all of these items in a list stored in a different variable or constant. What sort of problems could that cause as the list gets really big?
- Think of a column in an excel spreadsheet. Each cell contains data, and that data corresponds to a row number. The position in an array is referred to as the 'index number' and starts at 0.

- Pick one of the classes ideas and use it for the walkthrough. To start, build an array and fill it with a few pieces of data:
```Swift
var shoppingList = ["milk", "eggs", "bread", "turkey", "olive oil"]
```
