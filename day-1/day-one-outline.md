Afternoon

General Goal: 
Students will create their first swift program
Students will learn about swift data types, constants and variables, and operations
Students will learn to develop programs use TDD
Students will complete an iPhone application


SWBATs
download Xcode
understand the purpose of Xcode and the idea of a compiler
understand the difference between Integer, Double, String, and Boolean data types 
understand the difference between using a constant and a variable
demonstrate type annotation, understand it is unneccesary because of type inference
follow convention for naming variables
print data to the Xcode console
understand what a code comment is and how to write them
execute mathmatical operations in swift: +, -, *, /, %, also boolean operators



Lab Ideas
- Game Summary: Write a program that displays information about a players game summary (total playing time, high scores)
- Playlist App: hard-code a top ten list of songs and format it so that it looks cool. Use a different variable for each song.
        -second level iteration: use array for songs, dictionary for songs and artists
        -third level iteration: include logic in the code for... something

-Bio App: Make a bio about your partner. Begins with a skeleton app, students need to fill in constants, variables, and arrays. Have a place in the file structure to use a picture? 


-Calculator App:
