Practicing using let and var

1. Open a new XCode playground and name it TwitterArrays.

2. Pick a username for yourself and assign it to a variable called 'username'.

3. create five tweets and store them in a variable called tweets
'''Swift
    var tweets = ["fake tweet number one", "", "", "", ""]
'''
4. Print out the user's timeline. Format it with the tweet in the last index position at the top of the timeline. Make it look something like this:
```

```
5. Use a method to add another tweet to the tweets array.
