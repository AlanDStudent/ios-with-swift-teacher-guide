var num1: Double // = add some number here

var num2: Double // = add some other number here

var mathOperator: String // = put a +, -, *, or / here

var answer: Double // this variable will hold your answer. The caculations will all go inside of the conditional statement that you build.

//Bonus Round: give the use the option of rounding their answer to the nearest whole number.
//Write a more complex conditional statement(s) that can handle the extra decision.

var isRounded: Bool // = add true if you want to round any decimal off the end of your answer, and put false otherwise

//add conditional statement here

//Double Bonus Round
//Add more math functions to your calculator. Start out with a power function and a square root function, and then move on to some more advanced tools like sine or log.
