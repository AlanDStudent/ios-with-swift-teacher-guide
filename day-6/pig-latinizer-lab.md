##Pig Latinizer

Create an application with one text field where a user can type in a word. When the user hits enter, the app should convert that word into pig latin and display the pig latinized version on the page. You can read about the rules for pig latin [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin#Rules).
