##Background Color Wheel

Completed project code [here](https://github.com/upperlinecode/intro-to-swift/tree/master/day-6/BackgroundColorWheel)

###Students Will Be Able To
- Understand how user input fits into the MVC pattern
- Add a UIPickerView object to their project
- Link a UIPickerView object to the ViewController using an IBOutlet
- Submit information from a UIPickerView object and manipulate it in the controller

###Why
- Not all types of user input are as straightforward to implement as a text field. It's important to see these other types of objects, and understand that someone can use them in their application without understanding every line of code that comes along with it.

###Walkthrough
####Getting Started
- Create a one-page application in Xcode called BackgroundColorWheel. 
- The only object in the view will be a Picker View object that displays a spinning wheel of values from which the user can select one choice. Select a Picker View object and drag it to the center of the Main.storyboard scene.
