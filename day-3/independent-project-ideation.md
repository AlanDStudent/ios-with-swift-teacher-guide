## Independent Project Ideation

### Students Will Be Able To
- Brainstorm ideas with a partner for their first independent project
- Sketch a rough draft of the one-page application that they are going to make

### Motivation
Starting a project from scratch is a difficult task, and can lead to lots of time staring at a blank screen. We are going to work on three group projects in this class, so starting a project effectively is an important skill. We want to spend enough time brainstorming and planning so that we have a well formed idea before we start, but we also need to leave enough time to actually create our apps.

### Walkthrough
- The app that you build today is going to be similar in structure to the trivia app we build today. All of your apps will contain several of the same featuers:
  - single-page view 
  - one or more labels that are connected to the controller through IBOutlets
  - one or more buttons that are connected to the controller through IBActions
  - something on the screen will be updated when a button is pushed
  - a model that contains the data for your app.
