##Trivia App - Day Two
We're going to finish the trivia app that we started at the end of the day yesterday. So far, we've added a title label to the top of our page and a label in the center of the page that will later hold our various fun facts. The labels were pulled from the object library and we edited them using the attributes and size inspectors. We also added a background color by using the attributes inspector on the background of our storyboard.

####MVC Review
- Remember MVC? This stands for Model View Controller, and it describes the extremely popular design pattern that is used in desktop, mobile, and web applications.
