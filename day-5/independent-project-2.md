##Independent Project 2

###Concepts to Include
- MVC design pattern
- Object-oriented problem solving
- IBOutlets
- IBActions
- Constraints
- Optional values

###Motivation
Starting a project from scratch is a difficult task, and can lead to lots of time staring at a blank screen. We are going to work on three group projects in this class, so starting a project effectively is an important skill. We want to spend enough time brainstorming and planning so that we have a well formed idea before we start, but we also need to leave enough time to actually create our apps.

###Challenge:
- Find an iPhone app that you like and try to replicate a page from that app.
- Try to incorporate as many concepts from this week as you can. There is a general list above, but obviously we've covered a lot of ideas in the last five days and that list doesn't cover everything.
- Don't worry about adding user input yet. That will come next week.
