##Object Oriented Labels

###Students Will Be Able To
- Build a one-page application with IBActions to handle button events
- Create a label programatically rather than throught the GUI
- Use option types

###Why
Yesterday, students were able to change the background color of their apps using OO methods. Before that lab, they had only done that through the Attributes Inspector. This method of building out code programatically can be applied to all sorts of problems. Object Oriented programming keeps this code seperate from the view and abstracts the code from the controller.
